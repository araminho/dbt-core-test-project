Welcome to my new dbt project!

This dbt project is a hands-on learning and experimentation environment 
focused on building, testing, and documenting analytics engineering workflows.
It covers core dbt concepts such as staging and mart layers, data quality tests, 
unit tests, metrics, semantic modeling, and CI-related practices, 
with an emphasis on correctness and maintainability. 
The project was initially implemented using a Snowflake connection 
and later migrated to BigQuery, allowing comparison of adapter-specific behaviors 
and best practices while reinforcing platform-agnostic dbt design principles.

### Using the starter project

- dbt run
